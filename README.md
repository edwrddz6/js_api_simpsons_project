# The Simpsons Birthday Card

The Simpsons Birthday Card is a project built for retrieving a random quote from a Simpsons character presented in the form of a birthday card.

In this project, Axios makes the API call to retrieve JSON data from the [Simpsons API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/). The function created to call the API uses the Async/Await syntax to handle asynchronous operations.

You can access the project's webpage without having to download it.
